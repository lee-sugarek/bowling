# bowling
frame calculator

This is a small maven project project that calculates values for bowling frames given the rolls that occurred. 
Once pulled, you can test this code out by running the FrameCalculatorTest class and adjust the input arguments as well as the expected outputs for any other tests.
The FrameCalculator class is what performs the calculations and the FrameData class is a supporting data object class used for keeping the data organized.
